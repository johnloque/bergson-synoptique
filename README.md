## bergson-synoptique documentation

This repository contains a **synoptic edition of Henri Bergson's major works** (8 books from 1889 to 1934, including his two collections of essays and lectures) in the form a **TXM corpus** (xml sources are located in the 'src' sub-directory whereas the binary corpus is located in the 'bin' sub-directory).

This project allows philosophers to use TXM's statistical analyse tools while benefiting from the original pagination (for each page, the numerical transcription and the corresponding image from Gallica are displayed side by side), which ensures the texts' reliability and eases the quotation process.

This corpus is currently based on a minimal encoding ; feel free to suggest any improvement.
